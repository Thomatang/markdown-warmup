# markdown-warmup
Markdown exercise Hamilton Promo 3 Becode
## This is the greatest markdown example in history :stuck_out_tongue:

1. Website: http://www.pennyjuice.com/htmlversion/whoispj.htm  , pennyjuice.com
2. Is it updated frequently?
    The Code was last updated 21 January 2012, so no.
3. With a Google search :"Worst Websites of All Time"
    found this website in an artcile : https://www.branded3.com/blog/top-10-worst-websites/
4.  
   * Makes head hurt
   * Colors don't match up
   * Too much information 
   * No good structure  
   * MENU on the bottom, 
   * Text not properly presented
   * No headers,
   * Some pages text is all caps
   * Takes too long to find out what the website is about : WHAT is Pennyjuice?
   * E-commerce unfindable, not properly indexed
    
5. Not present at all : there is a Facebook group with 3 people ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/286764438489717/)

6.  *Burn, destroy and start anew*

    If not possible, here are our **recommendations**:
       - Implement same design concept for each page: visual identity
       - Choose a theme and choose less colors
       - Menu needs to be more clearly presented and put on top ( for blind people, too)
       - Fonts should be more uniform and readable, for example, do NOT put all CAPS on a page, and use bold, italics and larger fonts only to emphasize
       - Change name of the " Got Jucie?" page: to better indicate that it is an e-commerce page, for example : ORDER NOW
       
  
7. This website makes money because it is so bad , 1 dollar a day: link to statistics : http://pennyjuice.com.hypestat.com/
